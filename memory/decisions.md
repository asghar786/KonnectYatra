# Decisions

Narrative log of significant decisions and their context — the "why" behind choices
that aren't obvious from the code or git history.

For the **structured, reviewable** decision log (with 30-day review dates), see
[`decisions.csv`](./decisions.csv). This file is for richer prose, links, and follow-ups
that don't fit a CSV cell.

## 2026-06-16 — Go live on cPanel with symlink layout + GitHub Actions auto-deploy
- **Decision:** Deployed KonnectYatra live at https://konnectyatra.org. Repo cloned to `/home/rashad/konnectyatra`; main-domain docroot `public_html` is a symlink → `~/konnectyatra/public`. Auto-deploy via GitHub Actions over SSH on every push to `main` (`git pull` + `composer install --no-dev` + cache rebuild). Local XAMPP DB exported and imported into new DB `rashad_konnectyatra`.
- **Reasoning:** Main-domain docroot is locked to `public_html`, so a symlink gives clean URLs while keeping app code/.env out of the web root. Host has SSH + Composer, enabling true push-to-deploy without committing `vendor/` or storing tokens in the repo.
- **Alternatives considered:** (B) repo physically inside `public_html` with root `index.php` forward + `ASSET_URL=/public` — rejected (exposes app files, uglier URLs). (C) cPanel Git "Deploy HEAD" — no native auto-pull on push. (D) commit `vendor/` — bloats repo.
- **Fixes made along the way:** scrubbed all `Co-Authored-By: Claude` from history (force-push); pinned `laravel-dompdf` to working `^0.9.0` (lock mismatch); fixed PSR-4 case bug on two Admin controllers (Linux). Redesigned the home "President's message" section.
- **Follow-ups:** rotate DB + Gmail app passwords (shared in chat); the cached GitHub "claude" contributor should clear on its own.
- **Review:** see decisions.csv row dated 2026-06-16.
